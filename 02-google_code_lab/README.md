- NLU: Natural Language Understanding, the ability to understand and parse input spoken by the user

### 1.4: Starting a conversation

- (None.)

### 1.5: Create conversational responses

- Parameters (Dialogflow): values that Dialogflow parses from user input
- Dialogflow intent: maps user input to the agent's static or dynamic response
- Dialogflow webhook (fulfillment): code for handling intents and returning a dynamic response to the user
- Training phrase (Dialogflow): examples of user input used to train the model and match future inputs
- Entities (Dialogflow): a category of things, such as colors or dates
