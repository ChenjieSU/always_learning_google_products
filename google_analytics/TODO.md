# TODO.md

This file lists changes I need to make to my sites in order to bring them up-to-date with the latest recommended techniques.

These changes are based on what I am learning by going through the Analytics Academy's Google Analytics for Beginners class.

# Changes Needed - From the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

## From Part 1 of the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

### From Part 1, Section 3 (1.3 Google Analytics setup):

- Move the tracking code snippet from the end of the file to just after the `<head>` tag.

### From Part 1, Section 4 (1.4 Demo):

- Create three views for each site, as demonstrated in this section:
  - Raw Data
  - Test View
  - Master View
- Create filter for my IP address in the Test View
- Test the filter
- Copy it to the Master View

## From Part 3 of the Google Analytics for Beginners Class

### From Part 3, Section 1 (3.1 Audience reports):

- In Analytics: Enable Demographics and Interest Reports:
  - Click Audience in left nav -> Demographics -> Overview
  - Click Enable and wait a day or two
  - OR: Admin -> Property tab -> Property Settings
  - Turn on "Enable Demographics and Interest Reports" -> Save

# Changes Needed - From the Advanced Google Analytics Class

## From Part 2 of the Advanced Google Analytics Class

### From Part 2, Section 1 (2.1 Managing multiple accounts):

- Link to section: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7165242?hl=en
- Link at end of section: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033876?hl=en

- Set up cross-domain tracking for seeourminds.com and groja.com
- **Note:** This is easier using Google Tag Manager, so may want to put this off until after that class

### From Part 2, Section 6 (2.6 More useful configurations):

- Second drop down on this page is about setting up site search.

**We will want to do this someday, but skip it for now.**
