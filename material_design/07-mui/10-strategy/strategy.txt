Strategy for getting from MUI downloaded sample code to what I want for tomhartung.com .

Header: css link tags - mostly use CDN

- Pull common elements out of each index.html file into base.html template
- Any additional link tags in 03-landing_page_with_extras put in home.html template
   - That is the only page we want with those effects
- Exception: font-awesome css
  - Put in base.html so we can use them on all pages
- See css/style-00.txt for more details

Navigation:
1. Started out with the repsonsive_side_menu MUI example template
2. Decided to go with something similar to the landing_page MUI example template
3. May want to use, or mix in elements of the repsonsive_side_menu template later

Body:

- Use versions.html template for any markup needed for "normal," non-landing pages
