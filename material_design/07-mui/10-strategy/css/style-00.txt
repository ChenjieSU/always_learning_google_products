Setup:
  cp 01-blog/Site/blog/static/style.css style-01.css
  cp 02-landing_page/Site/landing-page/static/style.css style-02.css
  cp 03-landing_page_with_extras/Site/landing-page-with-extras/static/style.css style-03.css
  cp 04-responsive_side_menu/Site/responsive-side-menu/static/style.css style-04.css

Notes:
  style-01 is the smallest, and we do not want the site to look like that
  style-02 and style-03 are very similar.
  style-04 is much bigger than the others.

Strategy 1:
  Use style-04.css , and add content from style-03.css if necessary

Update:
  Decided we do not have any need for the responsive side menu right now
  Saving the current version of base.html as responsive_side_menu-base.html
  Reverting to basing the navigation base.html on the 02-landing_page example

Strategy 2:
  Use style-02.css , and add content from style-03.css if necessary
  The need to add content from style-03.css seems unlikely, given they are very similar
