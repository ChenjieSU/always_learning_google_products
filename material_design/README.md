## Directories

- `01-code_labs`
  - Six google codelabs, the last one using react
- `02-material_design_light`
  - We really want a very simple site
- `03-materialize`
  - Looks like it might be an alternative
- `04-prototypes`
  - Experimental area to ensure
    - We can get essential pages to look satisfactory or even good using the chosen framework
    - We have a starting point that does not depend on npm serving the code
- `05-material_design_bootstrap`
  - Exploring using this for groja.com or seeourminds.com or both
- `06-landing_page_examples`

## Deciding on Materialize Over MDL

### Bottom Line:

- Reviewing the article on tutorialzine.com, it really comes down to MDL or Materialize
- MDL will work ok, but it looks like Materialize has more functionality, which might come in handy in the future
- I like the idea of using the paralax theme for the home page

### Other notes:

- According to builtwith.com, MDL is much more popular than Materialize
  - 56,223 sites on 8/5/2018: https://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Material-Design-Lite
  - 2,446 sites on 8/5/2018: https://trends.builtwith.com/framework/Materialize
- MDL comes from google, Materialize is totally open source
- MDL designed for static pages, Materialize feels more flexible

## Comments

- `01-code_labs`
  - Left me unsure whether I want to use either material design or react or both
- `02-material_design_light`
  - MDL is definitely a viable candidate
- `03-materialize`
  - Also a viable candidate
- `04-prototypes`
  - Experimental area to ensure we want to continue with Materialize
- `05-material_design_bootstrap`
  - Exploring using this for groja.com or seeourminds.com or both
- `06-landing_page_examples`
  - Looking to re-do groja.com and seeourminds.com using material design
    - MDL, Materialize, or MDB - using any one of these will be fine
    - Idea: Materialize for artsyvisions.com, MDL for groja.com, and MDB for seeourminds.com
  - Looking to re-do those landing pages
  - Want to look at a bunch of them and think about it for awhile
