- Looking to re-do groja.com and seeourminds.com using material design
- Looking to re-do those landing pages
- Want to look at a bunch of them and think about it for awhile

## Idea

[x] Materialize for artsyvisions.com
[ ] MDL for groja.com
[ ] MDB for seeourminds.com

## Examples

### MDL

- The templates page at getmdl.io
  - https://getmdl.io/templates/
- The showcase page at getmdl.io - all google sites
  - https://getmdl.io/showcase/
- An Overview of Material Design Lite (no real examples)
  - https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-overview-of-material-design-lite--cms-24370
- Showcase on github:
  - https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki/Community-Showcase
- HugoMDL: simple and responsive theme
  - https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-mdl/
  - https://github.com/jchatkinson/HugoMDL
  - Does not work out of the box, which makes me suspicious, leaving it for now

### Materialize

- Showcase at materializecss.com
  - https://materializecss.com/showcase.html
