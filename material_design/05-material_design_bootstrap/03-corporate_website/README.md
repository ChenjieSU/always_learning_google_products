Thinking seriously about using something similar to this for all but the home page on Groja.com .

## Corporate Website Tutorial

### Lesson 1:

- Creating `index-docs.html`, with navigation code from the docs instead of the tutorial
- Looks to be the same, except for the size and color
  - Not studying it in great detail at this point

### Lesson 2:

- Adding cards with images and buttons, nice but nothing earth-shatteringly new though

### Lesson 3:

- Leaving the colors in `index.html` alone
- Changing the css in `index-tutorial.html` instead; `index-tutorial.html` copied from `index.html`

#### Steps 1-2

- Footer: `.container` looks better than `.container-fluid`
- Navigation: `.container` looks better than nothing at all

#### Step 3 - Colors

#### Steps 4-6 - Margin and Padding Classes

- Step 4: just adding `class="mt-5"` to `<main>` certainly helps
- Step 5: `class="mb-4"` - margin-bottom 4 rem
- Step 6: `class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"` explained:
  - Column uses 4 of 12 available columns on large screens
  - Column uses 6 of 12 available columns on medium and small screens
