I like the look of the new ArtsyVisions.com, and am thinking about using some of these styles on SeeOurMinds.com and Groja.com

Thinking it is a good time to take a look at Material Design for Bootstrap.

## Details

### `00-downloaded/`

Unzipped downloaded file into `Site` .

### `01-mdb-quick-start/`

Looks worth exploring further.

### `02-landing_page`

#### Lesson 1: Navigation

There are a lot of options available:

- https://mdbootstrap.com/components/navbar/

Tips for optimal background image:

> You can use whatever image you want, but there are a few rules which you should follow.

> Your image should be big enough to keep the quality and as lightweight as possible to not increase a page load time. That's why I recommend you prepare your picture as follows:

> 1. Resolution: 1920px / 1280px
> 2. JPG file format
> 3. Compress the file (you can use COMPRES JPG tool)

#### Lesson 2: Content Part I-A (Mask Content)

- Does not look very good!

#### Lesson 3: Content Part I-B (Mask Content)

- Looks much better!

#### Lesson 4: Content Part II (Best Features)

- Not much to comment on

#### Lesson 5: Content Part III (Examples Section)

- The mask div needs to be inside the same div as the img tag
- The image needs to be inside an anchor tag to activate the ripple effect when clicking

#### Lesson 6: Content Part IV (Gallery Section)

- At this time, I am not planning to use a carousel...

#### Lesson 7: Content Part V-A (Contact Section - Form)

- Makes the form look very modernistic

#### Lesson 8: Content Part V-B (Contact Section - Map)

- Played around with it a bit to get the lat-long for where I am
