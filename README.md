This repo is for learning how to program the Google Assistant.

## GDG Denver Virtual Hackathon

### Bechdel Test

- Docs out of sync, got confused quickly, with the welcome intent.

### Tom's Trivia

- This is looking better than the dialogflow attempt.

### Founding Fathers Trivia

- Cleaned up copy of Tom's trivia with some additional questions and better images.

### Quick Personality Type Quiz

- Single-word mini-description for each type come from http://www.personalityperfect.com/16-personality-types/ .
- Doesn't work very well, but I feel like I'm getting the hang of things

### Founding Fathers Flash Cards

- Basing these on info used in the Trivia game
- Trying to invoke this got hosed because it kept hearing 'flashcards' instead of flash cards' and I tried to rename it
  then tried to delete it and that messed up the ability to properly invoke the new project.  Seriously.
  The old one is scheduled for full deletion in a month, on 5/29.
- Cleared up the issue with the two projects but still unable to invoke the app
- Retry from scratch with a new project name: Founding Fathers Factoids

### Founding Fathers Factoids

- Re-using same data created (copied from the trivia game) for Founding Fathers Flash Cards
