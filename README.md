This repo is for learning how to program the Google Assistant.

## GDG Denver Virtual Hackathon

### Bechdel Test

- Docs out of sync, got confused quickly, with the welcome intent.

### Tom's Trivia

- This is looking better than the dialogflow attempt.

### Founding Fathers Trivia

- Cleaned up copy of Tom's trivia with some additional questions and better images.

#### Notes and hints:

Creating a "Follow up" with two sentences seems to cause a validation error that cannot be easily cleared.
You need to clear the cell and start over.

To get Google Assistant to load a new spreadsheet:

- Overview -> Trivia Actions - is the same as just:
- Actions -> Trivia Template - then do
- Content -> Next -> Upload - I don't think you need to change the url, we just want to make it Upload the new data
- Create App
- Simulator
